LEGOSCRIPT is mostly a part substitution tool for digital lego models, while you can build manually and algorthmically in LS, its main strength comes from being able to modify existing LDRAW models in an advanced way.

These LDRAW files can be converted into .mpd/.dat/.lxf/.lxfml/.io by their respective editing programs.

LS is also supposed to serve as a standardized notation for LEGO construction too, and in a manner that is as self-explanatory as possible so that people of all ages can quickly get to grips with it.

Here are some examples of what it can be used for:

• Implementing and planning MODs on models without having to tear a physical model apart
• Reducing or increasing parts count of a model while maintaining the structural, asthetic, and mechanical elements it may have.
• Increasing internal space of a model to save on cost of buying parts
• Increasing internal space of a model to allow more MODs.
• algorthmically building structures, this can be as simple or complex as one wishes, a basic example might be generating an assembly which is inherently quite repetitive, rather than manually building it piece by piece.
• Building sets or MOCs digitally.
• Substituting legacy, expensive,or rare/discontinued parts with more common or affordable ones.
• and so much more!

The LS software suite features:
•A GUI and CLI based IDE
• REPL or complilation modes (run, execute, print, loop)
• LS ↔ ldraw conversion tool
• A graphical/source output window
• Collision detection which can by bypassed but is not so trivial (in order to avoid build errors).
• Part search and auto complete menus
• Optional Auto insersion for Part names.
• Pane showing connection point names (types) and numbers.
• User limitable Recursion (This is for subassemblies and can be set to auto, which is calculated based on the system hardware resources.
• Builtin watchdog timer which can warn, terminate or resume infinate, or strenuous operations.
• LS subassemblies as part of the language which arenestable and as stated, can be recursive.
• Filters for the part search menus (hide stickers/stickered/printed/donor/alias/shortcut/helper/precolored/etc parts).
• Typecasting for part IDs, useful for alignment of parts and advanced building.
• Fully customize interface
• graphical output has various GFX settings. (e.g. show/hide part lines, lighting, shader options, dev options)
• Multithreading support
• Part/subassembly initialization
• Wireframe mode
• and so much more!
